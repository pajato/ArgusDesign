# Argus Design

This project captures the living design and high level documentation for *Argus*, an iOS and Android mobile app normalizing the experience of enjoying streaming videos from a number of video content providers.

The following documents are provided:

+ A usage narrative providing [the original vision](vision.org) for *Argus*

+ A high level [component structure diagram](highLevelComponentStructure.md) showing the major modules. Note that the web, iOS and Android GUI modules are but minor details in the overall application scope. This is the influence of Clean Architecture.

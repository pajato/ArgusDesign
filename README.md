# Argus Design

This project captures the living design and high level documentation for *Argus*, a mobile app normalizing the experience of enjoying streaming videos from a number of content providers.

The following documents are provided:

+ A usage narrative providing [the original vision](vision.org) for *Argus*

+ A high level [component structure diagram](structure.md) showing the major modules. Note that the iOS and Android GUI modules are but minor details in the overall application scope. This is the influence of Clean Architecture.

* Video use cases
   * register a video
   * update a video
   * find a video by id
   * find a video by name
   * find a video by fuzzy matching
